# Enigma
## Project Overview
Enigma is a program developed to encrypt and decrypt messages based on Caesar's Cipher. It allows the user to input a file with an English message into the encrypt method, and then will create a new file with the encrypted message. The program creates a randomly selected 5 digit number as the key and uses today's date as the offset value. The encrypted message can then be decrypted into a new file given a key and date.

## Areas of Focus
- Practice breaking a program into logical components
- Build classes that demonstrate single responsibilities
- Test drive a well-designed Object Oriented solution
- Work with file i/o
